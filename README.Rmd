This package creates short sprint (<6sec) profiles using the split times or the radar gun data. Mono-exponential equation is used to estimate maximal sprinting speed (MSS), relative acceleration (TAU), and other parameters. These parameters can be used to predict kinematic and kinetics variables and to compare individuals.

## Installation

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("shorts")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mladenjovanovic/shorts")
```

## Examples

`shorts` comes with two sample data sets: `split_times` and `radar_gun_data` with N=5 athletes. Let's load them both:

```{r example}
require(shorts)
require(tidyverse)

data("split_times", "radar_gun_data")
```

### Profiling using split times 

To model sprint performance using split times, distance will be used as predictor and time as target. Since `split_times` contains data for multiple athletes, let's extract only one athlete and model it using `shorts::model_using_splits` function:

```{r}
kimberley_data <- filter(split_times, athlete == "Kimberley")

kimberley_profile <- shorts::model_using_splits(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time)  

kimberley_profile

summary(kimberley_profile)

coef(kimberley_profile)
```

To show used data and predicted outcome (in this case time variable), explore the returned object:

```{r}
kimberley_profile$data
```

`shorts::model_using_splits` returns an object with `parameters`, `model_fit`, `model` returned from `stats::nls` function and `data` used to estimate parameters. Parameters estimated using mono-exponential equation are *maximal sprinting speed* (MSS), and *relative acceleration* (TAU). Additional parameters computed from MSS and TAU are *maximal acceleration* (MAC) and *maximal relative power* (PMAX). 

If you are interested in calculating average split velocity, use `shorts::format_splits`

```{r}
shorts::format_splits(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time)
```

Let's plot observed vs fitted split times. For this we can use `data` returned from `shorts::model_using_splits` since it contains `pred_time` column, but we can also use `shorts:predict_` family of functions. 

```{r}
ggplot(kimberley_profile$data, aes(x = distance)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_point(aes(y = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_time)) +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab("Time (s)")
```

To plot predicted velocity, acceleration, and relative power over distance, use `shorts:predict_`

```{r}
kimberley_pred <- tibble(
  distance = seq(0, 40, length.out = 1000),
  
  # Velocity
  pred_velocity = shorts::predict_velocity_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU),
  
  # Acceleration
  pred_acceleration = shorts::predict_acceleration_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU),
  
  # Power
  pred_power = shorts::predict_relative_power_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU),
)

# Convert to long
kimberley_pred <- gather(kimberley_pred, "metric", "value", -distance)

ggplot(kimberley_pred, aes(x = distance, y = value)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~metric, scales = "free_y") + 
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab(NULL)
```

To do prediction simpler, use `predict` function. This will provide kinematics for 0-6s sprint using 100Hz. 

```{r}
predicted_kinematics <- predict(kimberley_profile)
head(predicted_kinematics)
```

To get model residuals, use `residuals` function:

```{r}
residuals(kimberley_profile)
```

Package `shorts` comes with `find_` family of functions that allow finding peak power and it's location, as well as *critical distance* over which velocity, acceleration, or power drops below certain threshold:

```{r}
# Peak power and location
shorts::find_max_power_distance(
  kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU
)

# Distance over which power is over 50%
shorts::find_power_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  TAU = kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
  percent = 0.5
)

# Distance over which acceleration is under 50%
shorts::find_acceleration_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  TAU = kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
  percent = 0.5
)

# Distance over which velocity is over 95%
shorts::find_velocity_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  TAU = kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
  percent = 0.95
)
```

#### Mixed-effect models

Each individual can be modeled separately, or we can perform *non-linear mixed model* using `nlme` function from *nlme* package (Pinheiro *et al.*, 2019). This is done using `shorts::mixed_model_using_splits`:

```{r}
mixed_model <- shorts::mixed_model_using_splits(
  data = split_times,
  distance = "distance",
  time = "time",
  athlete = "athlete"
)

mixed_model

summary(mixed_model)
```

`shorts::mixed_model_using_splits` return the similar object, but `parameters` contain two elements: `fixed` and `random`. 

Let's plot predicted velocity over distance for athletes in the `split_times` data set:

```{r}
velocity_over_distance <- merge(
    mixed_model$parameters$random,
    data.frame(distance = seq(0, 40, length.out = 1000))
)

velocity_over_distance$pred_velocity <- with(velocity_over_distance,
  shorts::predict_velocity_at_distance(
    distance = distance,
    MSS = MSS,
    TAU = TAU)
)

ggplot(velocity_over_distance, aes(x = distance, y = pred_velocity, color = athlete)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab("Predicted velocity (m/s)")
```

### Profiling using radar gun data

The radar gun data is modeled using measured velocity as target variable and time as predictor. Individual analysis is performed using `shorts::model_using_radar` function. Let's do analysis for Jim:

```{r}
jim_data <- filter(radar_gun_data, athlete == "Jim")

jim_profile <- shorts::model_using_radar(
  time = jim_data$time,
  velocity = jim_data$velocity
)

jim_profile

summary(jim_profile)
```

The object returned from `shorts::model_using_radar` is same as object returned from `shorts::model_using_splits`. Let's plot Jim's measured velocity and predicted velocity: 

```{r}
ggplot(jim_profile$data, aes(x = time)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(y = velocity), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_velocity), color = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Time (s)") +
  ylab("Velocity (m/s)")
```

Radar gun data can be modeled individually or using *non-linear mixed model* implemented in `shorts::mixed_model_using_radar`:

```{r}
mixed_model <- shorts::mixed_model_using_radar(
  data = radar_gun_data,
  time = "time",
  velocity = "velocity",
  athlete = "athlete"
)

mixed_model

summary(mixed_model)
```

Let's plot predicted acceleration over time (0-6sec) for athletes in the `radar_gun_data` data set:

```{r}
model_predictions <- predict(mixed_model)

ggplot(model_predictions, aes(x = time, y = acceleration, color = athlete)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Time (s)") +
  ylab("Predicted acceleration (m/s^2)")
```

### Using corrections

You have probably noticed that estimated MSS and TAU were a bit too high for splits data. Biased estimates are due to differences in starting positions and *timing triggering methods* for certain measurement approaches (e.g. starting behind first timing gate, or allowing for body rocking). This topic is further explained in `sprint-corrections` [vignette](https://mladenjovanovic.github.io/shorts/articles/sprint-corrections.html) that can be accessed by typing:

``` r
vignette("sprint-corrections")
```

Here I will provide quick summary. Often, this bias in estimates is dealt with by using heuristic rule of thumb of adding `time_correction` to split times (e.g. from 0.3-0.5sec; see more in Haugen *et al.*, 2012). This functionality is available in all covered `shorts` functions: 

```{r}
mixed_model_corrected <- shorts::mixed_model_using_splits(
  data = split_times,
  distance = "distance",
  time = "time",
  athlete = "athlete", 
  time_correction = 0.3
)

mixed_model_corrected

summary(mixed_model_corrected)
```

And `time_correction` can also be used in `predict_` and `find_` family of functions:

```{r}
velocity_over_distance_corrected <- merge(
    mixed_model_corrected$parameters$random,
    data.frame(distance = seq(0, 40, length.out = 1000))
)

velocity_over_distance_corrected$pred_velocity <- with(velocity_over_distance,
  shorts::predict_velocity_at_distance(
    distance = distance,
    MSS = MSS,
    TAU = TAU,
    time_correction = 0.3)
)

ggplot(velocity_over_distance_corrected, aes(x = distance, y = pred_velocity, color = athlete)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab("Predicted velocity (m/s)")
```

Instead of providing for `time_correction`, this parameter can be estimated using `shorts::model_using_splits_with_time_correction` and `shorts::mixed_model_using_splits_with_time_correction`:

```{r}
kimberley_profile_with_time_correction <- shorts::model_using_splits_with_time_correction(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time)  

kimberley_profile_with_time_correction

# Mixed-effect model using `time_correction` as fixed effect only
# To use `time_correction` as random effects, use corrections_as_random_effects = TRUE
mixed_model_with_time_correction <- shorts::mixed_model_using_splits_with_time_correction(
  data = split_times,
  distance = "distance",
  time = "time",
  athlete = "athlete",
  corrections_as_random_effects = FALSE
)

# Parameters
mixed_model_with_time_correction
```
