Description: This package creates short sprint (<6sec) profiles using the split times or the radar gun data.
    Mono-exponential equation is used to estimate maximal sprinting speed (MSS), relative acceleration (TAU),
    and other parameters. These parameters can be used to predict kinematic and kinetics variables and to 
    compare individuals. The modeling method utilized in this package is further explained in the following
