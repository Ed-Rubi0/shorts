Description: Shorts is R package that creates profiles using the split times or the radar gun data
    of the short sprints (<6sec). Mono-exponential equation is used to model sprint data and to 
    estimate maximal sprinting speed (MSS), relative acceleration (MSS), and other parameters. These
    parameters can be used to predict kinematic and kinetics variables and to compare individuals.
